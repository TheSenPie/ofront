Tested on 32-bit Raspbian Linux for Raspberry PI 4B.
Uses libc.so.6, libm.so.6, libX11.so.6.

Run 'make' for a build.
Look at the 'makefile' for the build process.

It may be required to create a link for libX11.so. For RPi4B Raspbian issue following commands:
```
ln -s /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libX11.so.6 ./libX11.so
ln -s /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libm.so.6 ./libm.so
ln -s /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6 ./libc.so
```

Makefile assumes, that $PATH points to existing ofront binary. For that, download the binaries from http://www.software-templ.com/shareware.html, then extract using:
```
tar xzf /path/to/binaries.tar.gz
```
After, add the binaries to your $PATH variable, with:
```
export $PATH=$PATH:/path/to/ofront/bin
```

Finally, when building the binaries it may fail on libspi step, since ofront for Raspberry Pi uses WiringPi, however its developer discontinued its support and it is not pre-installed on raspbian anymore, meaning you have to download it manually. Fortunatelly, there is an unoffical mirror for WiringPi bindings, which you can get here: https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi
